## 🔍 Grade Calculation Logic

You can define your own grading scheme, for example:

| Average Marks | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 90 – 100      | A+    |
| 75 – 89       | A     |
| 60 – 74       | B     |
| 50 – 59       | C     |
| Below 50      | Fail  |

> Modify this logic in `grade.js` as needed.
